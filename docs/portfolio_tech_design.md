# How can we store the user portfolio so that they can ask question around it

## What we need
- A way to store user information   
    - ID
    - Email
    - Name?
    - Risk appetite?

- A way to store the portfolio of a user
    - Portfolio id
    - User id that the portfolio belongs to
    - Portfolio holdings
        - Asset class? (stock, etf, crypto etc)
        - Asset identifier(symbol)
        - Quantity?


Use noqsql database as a starting point for faster development?

Update api docs with the new endpoints for user and portfolio
