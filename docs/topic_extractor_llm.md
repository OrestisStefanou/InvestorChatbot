# How to use an llm to determine the topic of the conversation
- Create a prompt with some examples of conversation and what the topic should be
- Topic should be passed in the llm dynamically so that in case we add another topic it can work outside of the box?
    - Prompt will need an update anyway so this probably not neccesary
- In case we add a new topic the prompt should be updated
